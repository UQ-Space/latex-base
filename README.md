LaTeX Base
==========

A group of classes and packages written using the
[LaTeX 3](https://www.latex-project.org/latex3/) project, predominantly for LaTeX
documentation within UQ Space. All LaTeX work is stored in the `.dtx` DocTeX
file format, to allow for simultaneous documentation and implementation through
the `l3doc` class.

`uqsreport`
---------
This is the class file that is used for LaTeX reports. It contains several
options that allow it to suit most internal and external report cases, without
tweaking.
